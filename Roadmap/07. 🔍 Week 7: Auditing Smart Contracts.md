### **🔍 Week 7: Auditing Smart Contracts**

This week, you'll focus on the critical skills needed to audit smart contracts effectively. Auditing is the final line of defense before a contract is deployed to mainnet, and it requires a deep understanding of both the code and the potential attack vectors.

#### **📝 Day 5-6: Manual Code Review and Attack Simulation**

* 📌 **Deep Dive into Code Review**

  * Manual code inspection for complex vulnerabilities
  * Identifying reentrancy, integer overflows, and logic flaws
* 📌 **Simulating Real-World Attacks**

  * Using Foundry and Hardhat to replicate known exploits
  * Testing for race conditions and flash loan attacks
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Smart Contract Manual Review Guide](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2020/06/smart-contract-review-checklist/)

#### **📝 Day 7: Reporting and Communication**

* 📌 **Writing High-Quality Audit Reports**

  * Clear, concise, and actionable vulnerability descriptions
  * Providing remediation advice and risk ratings
  * Communicating with developers and project teams
* 📌 **Audit Tools and Templates**

  * Using Markdown, Google Docs, or Notion for professional reports
* 📌 **Reading:**
