  * [Example of Good PoCs](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/pocs)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Write a PoC for a vulnerability you identified earlier in the week (e.g., a DeFi exploit, reentrancy bug, or NFT issue).
  * Submit the PoC as part of a mock bug report.

#### **📝 Day 5-6: Communicating with Developers and Program Owners**

* 📌 **Professional Communication**

  * Be clear, concise, and polite when communicating with the program owner.
  * Avoid aggressive or accusatory language—frame your findings as helpful and constructive.
  * How to explain the severity of vulnerabilities and make recommendations that are actionable.
* 📌 **Handling Feedback and Revisions**

  * Understand how to handle the feedback you receive from the program owner.
  * If the vulnerability is fixed or deemed a non-issue, how to respond professionally and graciously.
  * How to update your report if new information arises or if further testing is required.
* 📌 **Reading:**
