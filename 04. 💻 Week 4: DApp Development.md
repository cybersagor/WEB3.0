### **💻 Week 4: DApp Development**

This week, you’ll connect your smart contract skills to the frontend, creating full-fledged decentralized applications (dApps). This is a critical step because most Web3 bugs are found at the intersection of smart contracts and their user interfaces.

#### **🔍 Day 1-2: DApp Architecture and Basic Setup**

* 📌 **Understanding DApp Architecture**

  * Frontend (React/Next.js)
  * Backend (Smart Contracts)
  * Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
* 📌 **Setting Up Your Development Environment**

  * Install Node.js, npm, and Hardhat
  * Create a basic project with **Create-React-App** or **Next.js**
  * Set up your MetaMask wallet and connect to the Goerli testnet
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Introduction to DApps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/)
  * [Connecting MetaMask to DApps](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Build a simple dApp that interacts with a smart contract (e.g., a greeting contract).
  * Test your dApp locally using Hardhat.

#### **🔍 Day 3-4: Interacting with Smart Contracts**

* 📌 **Using Web3.js and Ethers.js**

  * Web3.js vs Ethers.js - Key differences
  * Connecting to smart contracts and reading on-chain data
  * Handling transactions and gas fees
* 📌 **State Management and Data Flow**

  * Using React hooks for managing contract state
  * Fetching real-time blockchain data
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Ethers.js Documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)
  * [Web3.js Documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Build a token balance checker that fetches the user’s ERC-20 token balance.
  * Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Ethers.js listeners.

#### **🔍 Day 5-6: Advanced DApp Features**

* 📌 **Integrating MetaMask and WalletConnect**

  * Handling account changes and network switches
  * Securely signing messages and transactions
* 📌 **Decentralized File Storage (IPFS)**

  * Uploading and retrieving data from IPFS
  * Using Pinata or Web3.Storage for reliable file storage
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [IPFS Overview](https://docs.ipfs.tech/)
  * [Web3Modal for Wallet Integration](https://web3modal.com/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Build a simple file sharing dApp using IPFS.
  * Integrate WalletConnect for mobile wallet support.

#### **🔍 Day 7: Frontend Security and Best Practices**

* 📌 **Frontend Security Considerations**

  * Preventing reentrancy and front-running attacks from the frontend
  * Handling private key leakage and secure transaction signing
  * Mitigating phishing and social engineering risks
* 📌 **Optimizing Gas Costs and User Experience**

  * Implementing gas-efficient smart contract calls
  * Using layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism)
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Web3 Frontend Security](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2020/06/secure-smart-contract-frontends/)
  * [Gas Optimization Techniques](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Refactor your previous projects for better gas efficiency and security.
  * Use Tenderly to simulate and optimize gas costs.
