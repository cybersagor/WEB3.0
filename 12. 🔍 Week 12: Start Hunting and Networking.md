### **🔍 Week 12: Start Hunting and Networking**

Now that you've built up your knowledge and sharpened your skills, it's time to start actively participating in the Web3 bug bounty space. This week will focus on applying everything you've learned through hands-on hunting, as well as growing your network within the bug bounty and Web3 community. It’s crucial to start hunting, get real-world experience, and build relationships that can help you in your journey.

#### **📝 Day 1-2: Choose Your Platforms and Start Hunting**

* 📌 **Explore Popular Web3 Bug Bounty Platforms**

  * **Immunefi**: A leading platform for Web3 security bugs, especially DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts.
  * **HackerOne**: One of the most popular platforms for reporting Web3 bugs, with various programs running across decentralized projects.
  * **Bugcrowd**: Another platform that hosts Web3-related programs and rewards researchers for finding vulnerabilities.
  * **OpenZeppelin**: Known for smart contract audits, OpenZeppelin runs bounties for projects that are focused on security.
* 📌 **Choosing the Right Bug Bounty Program**

  * How to choose a program based on the complexity of the target, your expertise, and the types of vulnerabilities you are interested in.
  * Analyze the scope of the program, the reward structure, and any exclusions that could impact your hunting.
  * Popular platforms for Web3-specific programs: [Immunefi Bounties](https://immunefi.com/), [HackerOne Web3 Bounties](https://www.hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs/web3), [Bugcrowd Web3](https://www.bugcrowd.com/web3-bug-bounty/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Sign up on Immunefi, HackerOne, or Bugcrowd and find Web3 programs to hunt in.
  * Look for an open bug bounty in a DeFi protocol or NFT platform, then study the program’s scope and submit a test vulnerability.

#### **📝 Day 3-4: Focused Hunting and Real-World Exploits**

* 📌 **Hunting DeFi and NFT Vulnerabilities**

  * Start focusing on DeFi protocols (e.g., lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, yield farming) and NFT platforms.
  * Common vulnerabilities to look for include:

    * **Reentrancy attacks**
    * **Flash loan exploits**
    * **Integer overflow/underflow**
    * **ERC-20/ERC-721 vulnerabilities**
    * **Access control issues**
  * Use the tools you learned about earlier (e.g., **Echidna**, **Slither**) to analyze smart contracts and look for common pitfalls.
* 📌 **Real-World Exploit Scenarios**

  * Try to reproduce vulnerabilities from past Web3 exploits (e.g., reentrancy attacks in DeFi, critical flaws in NFT minting contracts).
  * Focus on understanding how past vulnerabilities were exploited and replicate them in a controlled environment to learn more.
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Pick a vulnerability type (like reentrancy) and look for it in a Web3 contract.
  * Attempt to exploit it or submit a PoC if you find one.

#### **📝 Day 5-6: Learn the Art of Networking and Collaboration**

* 📌 **Building Your Personal Brand**

  * **Update Your HackerOne or Bugcrowd Profile**: Ensure your profile is well-written, professional, and reflects your Web3 expertise.
  * **Engage on Social Media**: Follow and engage with Web3 security researchers on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit. Share findings, participate in discussions, and stay updated on the latest trends in Web3 security.
  * **Write Medium Articles or Blog Posts**: Document your learnings or write about successful findings. Publishing your experience helps build your reputation.
  * **Join Web3 and Bug Bounty Discord Communities**: Participate in Discord groups where other bug bounty hunters, security researchers, and developers hang out.
* 📌 **Collaborating with Peers**

  * Collaborate on bug bounty hunts with others in the community—pairing up with someone with complementary skills can help you learn faster.
  * **Cross-pollinate knowledge**: Work with developers or other researchers to improve your skill set. Often, collaborating on finding bugs will help you grow and improve.
  * Be open to constructive feedback and learn from others in the community to boost your abilities.
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Connect with fellow Web3 bug hunters on Twitter, Discord, or LinkedIn.
  * Write a brief post or thread sharing your learnings and insights. For example, you can share what you've learned about smart contract vulnerabilities.

#### **📝 Day 7: Submit Your First Report**

* 📌 **Report Writing for Your First Submission**

  * Pick a vulnerability you've identified during the previous days and write a well-structured report.
  * Be sure to follow the best practices for bug report writing you’ve learned earlier: clear steps, a working PoC, a detailed explanation of the issue, and suggested remediation.
* 📌 **Submit the Report to the Program**

  * Submit your first report on the platform you’ve chosen (Immunefi, HackerOne, Bugcrowd).
  * Pay attention to the feedback you receive. Use it to improve your future submissions.
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Submit your first bug bounty report to a Web3 program.
  * Follow up on any feedback and make improvements to future submissions based on what you learn from the feedback process.

#### **💼 Networking and Community Engagement**

* **Attend Web3 Events and Conferences**

  * Many conferences host bug bounty-specific events, webinars, and workshops. Some notable ones include **ETHGlobal Hackathons**, **DefCon**, **BlackHat**, and **Web3 Summit**.
  * Attend these events to meet other bug bounty hunters, network with developers, and stay ahead of new Web3 vulnerabilities.
* **Join Web3 Bug Bounty Communities**

  * Platforms like Discord and Telegram have active communities for Web3 security researchers. You can join specialized channels for DeFi, NFTs, or general Web3 security.
  * Participate in bug bounty programs’ community channels to get support, share knowledge, and build rapport with other researchers.
