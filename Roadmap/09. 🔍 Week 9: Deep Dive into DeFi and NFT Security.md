### **🔍 Week 9: Deep Dive into DeFi and NFT Security**

This week, you’ll focus on one of the most lucrative and complex areas in Web3 security: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) security. Both of these areas are ripe for vulnerabilities, and understanding their unique attack vectors will give you a massive edge in bug bounty hunting. You’ll learn how to find, exploit, and report vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols and NFT systems.
