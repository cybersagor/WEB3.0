| **Solidity**         | Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon | Most popular; great to start with    |
| **Vyper**            | Ethereum                     | Pythonic alternative to Solidity     |
| **Yul / Yul+**       | Ethereum                     | Low-level intermediate language      |
| **Fe**               | Ethereum                     | Inspired by Rust + Python            |
| **Move**             | Sui, Aptos                   | Designed for secure asset management |
| **Rust**             | Solana, Near, Polkadot       | High-performance, low-level control  |
| **Cairo**            | StarkNet                     | For zkRollup smart contracts         |
| **Scilla**           | Zilliqa                      | Formal verification features         |
| **Clarity**          | Stacks                       | Predictable execution (no loops)     |
| **Michelson**        | Tezos                        | Stack-based, low-level               |
| **Haskell / Plutus** | Cardano                      | Strong typing, functional style      |
| **Go / CosmWasm**    | Cosmos                       | Smart contracts in Wasm modules      |
| **Ink! (Rust)**      | Polkadot/Substrate           | Smart contracts for Substrate chains |

> 🧠 **Tip:** Learn Solidity first, then branch out to Move, Rust, and Cairo as you grow.

## 🌐 Chapter 2: How Many Blockchain Platforms Exist?

While **hundreds** of blockchains exist, here are the **most relevant platforms** for smart contract developers and bounty hunters:

### 🏗️ Layer 1 (L1) Blockchains

These are standalone blockchains with their own consensus.

* Ethereum
* Solana
* BNB Chain
* Avalanche
* Cardano
* Sui
* Aptos
* Near
* Tezos
* Polkadot
* Cosmos

### ⚡ Layer 2 (L2) Solutions

These are scaling layers built on top of Layer 1 chains.

* Arbitrum
* Optimism
* Base
* StarkNet
* zkSync
* Linea

### 🧩 Modular and App-Specific Chains

* **Modular Chains**: Celestia, Fuel, EigenLayer
* **App-specific**: dYdX (Cosmos), Osmosis (Cosmos), Immutable X
* **Zero-Knowledge Chains**: Mina, StarkNet, zkSync Era, Scroll

> 📌 **L1 = Operating System**, **L2 = Performance Add-On**

---

## 👣 Chapter 3: Where Should You Start?

### 🔰 If You Know Solidity:

Focus on these chains:

* **Ethereum (L1)**
* **Arbitrum, Optimism (L2)**
* **Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain (EVM-compatible)**

### 🧪 If You Want to Explore More:

* Learn **Move**: Aptos, Sui
* Learn **Rust**: Solana, NEAR, Polkadot
* Learn **Cairo**: StarkNet (zkRollups)

> 🎯 Building cross-chain skills will help you find more unique bugs and make you stand out in audits.

---

## 🎯 Chapter 4: TL;DR Summary

* ✅ **Solidity** is dominant, but not the only smart contract language.
* 🔥 **Ethereum** is king, but don't ignore Aptos, Solana, StarkNet, and others.
* 🛠️ Learn Solidity deeply, then branch out into **Move**, **Rust**, and **Cairo**.
* 🧑‍💻 Focus on **Ethereum ecosystem** for bounties; expand to newer blockchains to stay ahead.
