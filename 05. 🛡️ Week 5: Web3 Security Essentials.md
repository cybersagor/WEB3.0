#### **🔍 Day 1-2: Understanding Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

* 📌 **Critical Web3 Vulnerabilities**

  * Reentrancy attacks
  * Integer overflow/underflow
  * Unchecked external calls
  * Front-running and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)
  * [SWC Registry (Smart Contract Weakness Classification)](https://swcregistry.io/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Deploy a vulnerable smart contract and exploit it using Hardhat.
  * Test a reentrancy attack using a simple staking contract.

---

#### **🔍 Day 3-4: Advanced Exploits and Attack Vectors**

* 📌 **Complex Attack Vectors**

  * Flash loan attacks
  * Cross-function reentrancy
  * Delegatecall injection
  * Signature replay attacks
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Understanding Flash Loans](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans)
  * [Delegatecall Security Considerations](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/delegatecall/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Create a flash loan contract and explore potential vulnerabilities.
  * Simulate a delegatecall exploit using Hardhat or Foundry.

---

#### **🔍 Day 5-6: Secure Development Practices**

* 📌 **Defensive Programming Techniques**

  * Using OpenZeppelin contracts for secure function calls
  * Implementing access control with RBAC
  * Utilizing circuit breakers and fail-safe mechanisms
* 📌 **Gas Optimization and Attack Surface Reduction**

  * Optimizing gas costs to reduce DoS risks
  * Minimizing contract complexity to lower attack surface
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Gas Optimization Techniques](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)
  * [Solidity Security Patterns](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Refactor a previous project (e.g., your ERC-20 token) for security and gas efficiency.
  * Use **Slither** and **MythX** to identify security issues.
