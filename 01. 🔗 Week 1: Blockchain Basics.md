#### **🔍 Day 1-2: Understanding Blockchain Technology**

* 📌 **What is a Blockchain?**

  * Distributed ledger technology (DLT)
  * Decentralization and trustless systems
  * Key properties: immutability, transparency, and security
* 📌 **Components of a Blockchain**

  * Blocks, transactions, and chains
  * Hash functions and Merkle trees
  * Consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Delegated PoS, BFT)
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Mastering Blockchain (Chapters 1-3)](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Blockchain-Programming-Decentralization-Cryptocurrency/dp/1789537142)
  * [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Use **Ether.js** to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
  * Explore block explorers like **Etherscan** and **BscScan**.

#### **🔍 Day 3-4: Transactions and Wallets**

* 📌 **How Transactions Work**

  * UTXO vs Account-based models
  * Gas fees and transaction costs
  * Mempools and pending transactions
* 📌 **Understanding Wallets**

  * Public and private keys
  * Digital signatures and ECDSA
  * Hot wallets (MetaMask) vs Cold wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Ethereum Account Model](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/)
  * [Public-Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Set up a MetaMask wallet and connect it to different networks.
  * Create your first Ethereum address and send a test transaction on Goerli testnet.

#### **🔍 Day 5-6: Consensus Mechanisms and Network Types**

* 📌 **Consensus Algorithms**

  * Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)
  * Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and BFT variants
  * Nakamoto consensus vs Byzantine Fault Tolerance
* 📌 **Types of Blockchain Networks**

  * Public (Ethereum, Bitcoin)
  * Private (Hyperledger, R3 Corda)
  * Consortium (Ripple, Quorum)
  * Layer 2 solutions (Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups, Plasma)
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [Proof of Stake Explained](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)
  * [Layer 2 Scaling Solutions](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Explore different Ethereum testnets (Sepolia, Goerli).
  * Use block explorers to inspect transaction histories and gas fees.

#### **🔍 Day 7: Key Blockchain Concepts**

* 📌 **Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Networks**

  * Why decentralization matters
  * P2P networking and data propagation
* 📌 **Cryptography in Blockchain**

  * Digital signatures and elliptic curve cryptography
* 📌 **Reading:**

  * [How Ethereum Works](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/how-ethereum-works/)
  * [Intro to Cryptography](https://cryptohack.org/)
* 📌 **Practical:**

  * Use **Keccak-256** to hash a message and verify signatures.
  * Test signature creation and verification in **Remix** or **MyCrypto**.
