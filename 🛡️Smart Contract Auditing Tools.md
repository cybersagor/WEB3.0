## 🔧 Chapter 1: Static Analysis Tools

*(Analyze code **without executing** it — ideal for quick scans, CI/CD, and early detection)*

---

### 1. 🔍 **Slither** — *The Static Analysis King*

**GitHub**: [cryctic/slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)

* **What it does**:

  * Detects 100+ known issues: uninitialized storage, reentrancy, unused return values, etc.
  * Outputs control flow graphs (CFGs), function graphs, and inheritance diagrams.
  * Highly customizable — you can write custom detectors in Python.

* **Why it's important**:

  * Industry standard.
  * Fast and comprehensive.

* **Installation**:

  ```bash
  pip install slither-analyzer
  ```

* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  slither . --detect all                # Scan full project
  slither MyContract.sol --triage-mode # Highlight issues interactively
  slither . --print human-summary      # Clean overview
  ```
